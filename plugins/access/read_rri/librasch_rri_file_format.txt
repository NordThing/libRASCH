libRASCH RRI File Format Version 0 (06.07.2004)
===============================================
Author: Raphael Schneider <rasch@med1.med.tum.de>


This is the first description of the RRI file format used in
libRASCH. Chances are high that it will be modified soon. So do NOT
rely on this description. If you have any comments/suggestions, please
send me these directly or to the libRASCH mailing list.



General design:
---------------
  * two parts: header and rr intervals

  * the two parts are seperated by '-' characters; the first character
    in a line MUST be a '-' character, the remaining characters can be
    choosen by the programmer; a line of 50 '-' characters is
    recommended

  * comments are allowed ONLY in the header section; comments MUST
    start with the '#' character at the first position of a line

  * for character encoding, UTF-8 is recommended

  * the rr-interval section starts IMMEDIATELY after the seperator
    line; NO empty lines are allowed in the rr-interval section
    (except the last one (if any), but in this line, only the new-line
    character is allowed)


header:
-------
  * first line MUST be of form: 'librasch-rri-Vx', 'x' is the current
    version number (current version is 0); the first line MUST be
    ASCII (or UTF-8, where the first 128 char's correspond to ASCII)

  * the next lines give further information, the general format is:
     
    info-name=info-value

      - no space after info-name and before info-value
      - info-name can NOT contain the '=' character
      - info-name can NOT start with the '-' character

  * the currently supported informations are:

      - number-qrs:
      - name:
      - forename:
      - birthday:
      - rec-date:
      - rec-time:
      - samplerate:
    

rr intervals:
-------------  
  * the remaining lines are holding the information about the QRS
    complexs

  * each line is of the format:

    qrs-position\tannotation  (with \t = tab-character)

      - qrs-position in sample units (if no samplerate was set in the
        header, 1000Hz is assumed)
      - annotation is one character describing the type of the qrs
        complex; the following annotations are supported:

	+ N: normal qrs complex
	+ V: ventricular qrs complex
	+ P: paced qrs complex
	+ X or anything else: artifact
