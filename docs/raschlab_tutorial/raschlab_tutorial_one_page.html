>Chapter 1. Introduction</H1
><P
>RASCHlab is a program based on libRASCH (http://www.librasch.org), which allows the user to
access time-series data. Additionally the user can process the signals
(e.g. perform a beat detection in ECG's) and perform calculations
based on the signals (e.g. calculate heart rate variability parameters
from an ECG).</P
><P
>The program provides access to different file formats (e.g. EDF(+),
MIT/AHA) and displays the informations which are included in a
signal. For example comments/annotations in an EDF+ file is shown and
the user can edit a comment or add a new one. Or when ECG's contain
informations about the position and types of the heart beats, RASCHlab
will show the positions and the user can edit/delete/insert the
beat positions.</P
><P
>This tutorial will show you the fundamental usage of RASCHlab. All
examples are shown on ECG's but generally it can be used for every
kind of signal.</P
><P
>At the moment libRASCH (the basis of RASCHlab)
supports best signals used in cardiology (e.g. ECG, continuous blood
pressure) by special plugins for displaying and processing these
signals. If you have experience with signal processing in other fields
and some ideas what would be nice to have in libRASCH/RASCHlab, please
send me an email (rasch@med1.med.tum.de) with your ideas and/or source
code.</P

CLASS="VARIABLELIST"

><DT
>Measurement</DT
><DD
><P
>A measurement is the topmost object in libRASCH. Measurements
consists of one or more sessions, information about the measurement
object (e.g. name, forename and birthday if the measurement object is
a person) and zero or more evaluations.</P
></DD
><DT
>Session</DT
><DD
><P
>A Session is a recording for a specific time interval without any
interruptions during this time interval. In a measurement can be more
than one session, but the layout of the recording (see below)
must not be changed.</P
></DD
><DT
>Recording</DT
><DD
><P
>A recording contains the measured data (e.g. ECG leads V1-V6). A
recording has one or more channels or two or more
sub-recordings. Sub-recordings are used if more than one
recording device is used. For example when one Analog/Digital
converter-system records
3 ECG leads and one bloodpressure channel and another system
records 12 EEG leads, the measurement consists of one top
recording with two sub-recordings. The first sub-recording
contains 4 channels (3 ECG and 1 bloodpressure channel) and the second
sub-recording contains 12 channels (12 EEG channels). </P
></DD
><DT
><A
NAME="EVALUATION"
></A
>Evaluation</DT
><DD
><P
>The results of an analysis (e.g. positions of heart beats in an ECG)
are stored in an evaluation. An evaluation contains zero or more
discrete events (e.g. 'occurence of a heart beat') and/or zero or
more continous events (e.g. 'recording period with noise'). In
measurements handled by libRASCH, more than one evaluation can be
available.</P
><P
>When an evaluation is added to the measurement by the original
recording system (e.g. the evaluation performed by commercial
long-term ECG systems), then this evaluation is called the
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>original</I
></SPAN
> evaluation.</P
><P
>If only one evaluation is available, it is no problem to choose an
evaluation when the user wants to process the evaluation. When more
than one evaluation is stored in a measurement, one of these
evaluations has to be the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>default</I
></SPAN
>
evaluation, which is used when no specific evaluation is selected. In
most cases the last added evaluation is set to the default
evaluation.</P
></DD
><DT
>Event</DT
><DD
><P
>An event describes the occurence of something in a recording (e.g. a
heartbeat in an ECG). An event has one or more event-properties.</P
></DD
><DT
>Event-Property</DT
><DD
><P
>An event-property is a specific property of the event (e.g. the position
of the event, the type of the event). A specific event-property is
allowed only once in an evaluation, for example there can be not more than one
'qrs-position' property.</P
></DD
><DT
>Event-Set</DT
><DD
><P
>An event-set describes a group of event-properties. For example the
event-set 'heartbeat' contains all properties which belongs to a heart
beat (e.g. position of the heart beat, the RR interval, the type of the
heart beat, systolic blood pressure).</P
></DD
><DT
>Plugins</DT
><DD
><P
>libRASCH makes heavy use of plugins. Plugins are small "programs" which
are loaded when libRASCH is initialized. In the plugins the real work is
done, the library-code "only" coordinates that the correct plugin is used and
does some other administrative tasks.

In libRASCH three principal types of plugins exist:

>Chapter 4. Open a Signal</H1
><P
>After starting RASCHlab, an empty workspace is shown. In this
workspace the signal and other information about the signal will be
shown. Now the first step will be to open a signal. To do this, select
the menu entry 'File/Open...' or press the open button on the toolbar
(an opening folder; the first button from left). This will open the
signal selection dialog box. <A
HREF="#RASCHLAB-SIG-SEL-FIG"
>Figure 4-1</A
> shows
the screen shot with the dialog box. The signal selection dialog box
is similar to the file browser in Windows, on the left side you can
select the folder. On the right side, the signals in the
selected folder will be shown. (Only the signals which are supported
by libRASCH are shown.)</P

folder, the available signals will be shown. Please select the signal
named '100s'. This is a short ECG (one minute) from the
PhysioNet database. To open the signal, you can double click on the 
signal-name or select the signal by clicking once on the signal-name
and then click on the OK button. Then the signal will be shown in the
signal window. <A

><P
>In the signal window, all channels of a measurement are shown. When
the measurement contains more than one type of signal (e.g. ECG and
arterial blood pressure) then each type of signal will be shown in
their own signal window (for an example see <A
HREF="#RASCHLAB-MORE-SIGS-FIG"
>Figure 6-1</A
>). To do this, libRASCH has to
"detect" which signals are stored in a measurement. In general purpose
file formats (e.g. file formats used by ADC systems), libRASCH tries
to estimate the signal-type by the channel name. In file formats which
have a fixed channel/signal-type relation, the signal type is set by
the plugin supporting the file format.</P

NAME="PROCESS-SIGNAL"
></A
>Chapter 5. Process a Signal</H1
><P
>After opening the ecg in the previous chapter, we want now to find the
postions of the beats in the ECG. libRASCH supports this by providing
a process plugin ('detect-simple') which performs a beat
detection. Additionally we want to group the found heart beats in
similar looking groups (templates) and we want to calculate
some ECG specific values (e.g. the intervals between each heart beat,
called RR intervals). The later two steps will be done in the
process plugins 'template' and 'ecg' respectively.</P
><P
>In RASCHlab, all the above mentioned steps will be performed when
selecting the menu entry 'Detect-&#62;Detect'. After selecting the menu entry,
the channel selection dialog box will be opened (<A
HREF="#RASCHLAB-SEL-DETECT-CH-FIG"
>Figure 5-1</A
>) and the user has to 
select the channels in which the heart beats should be searched. (At
the moment all available channels will be selectable, but this will be
changed in the future, showing only the channels which makes sense.)
To select the channels, click on the channel-name on the left side and
then click on the '-&#62;' button. This will move the channel-name to the
right side. <A
HREF="#RASCHLAB-SEL-DETECT-CH-2-FIG"

dialog box after selecting both channels.</P

>After selecting the channels, press the 'OK' button. Now the beat
detection, template grouping and the calculation of the ECG specific
values will be done. For each processing step, a progress dialog will
be shown. When all the processing is done, a window with ecg and the found
beats and a window with the templates will be shown (<A
HREF="#RASCHLAB-ECG-WITH-ANNOT-FIG"
>Figure 5-3</A
>).</P
><P
>Note that the detection of heart beats are not limited to file
formats which are used to store only ECG's. RASCHlab do not care which
file format was used to store a signal. For example when you have an
EDF file with ECG and EEG signals, you can perform the beat detection
the same way as described above. As written above, at the moment the
user has to be sure to select the correct channel containing an ECG
recording.</P

>RASCHlab allows you to correct the automatic evaluation of the ECG. A
description how you can change an evaluation of an ECG is given in <A
HREF="#RASCHLAB-ECG-VIEW-DESC"
>Section 9.1</A
>.</P
><P
>Evaluations created with RASCHlab are stored on disk at the same
position where the signal data is stored. The data is stored in a file
named using the name of the recording and for the file extension
'.mte' is used. For example the evaluation created above is stored in the
file '100s.mte'. The evaluation is stored using XML. The user can
control with the menu entry 'General-&#62;Save ASCII eval-values' if array
data (e.g. the positions of the heart beats) is stored as ASCII text
(menu entry with check mark) or as binary (menu entry without check
mark). When storing the data as ASCII text, it can be used easily with
other programs. On the other side, when a lot of events are in an evaluation (e.g. heart
beats in a 24 hour ECG), loading and saving took a lot of time. For
this type of signals, the binary format is recommended.</P

>6.2. Selections</A
></H2
><P
>In the signal-view-plugins, libRASCH supports the concept of
selections. Selections are a subset of events which have one common
property. For example you can select all heart beats which belongs
to the same template (i.e. all heart beats with similar morphology)
or you can select all ventricular beats. </P
><P
>In these selctions, you can step back and forth with the following keys:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"

></LI
><LI
STYLE="list-style-type: disc"
><P
>'b': go to the previous item in the selection</P
></LI
></UL
>
When a selection is "active", then the number of selected events and
the current position in the selection is shown in the signal view in
the lower right corner. The figure "12/456" means that you are
currently at the 12th event from 456 selected events. For example the
numbers inside the red circle in <A
HREF="#RASCHLAB-SEL-TEMPLATE-FIG"
>Figure 6-5</A
>.</P
><P
>Selections are implemented in the signal-specific view
plugins. Therefore the type of selections will differ from signal to
signal but the concept will be always the same independent of the
signal type. (Because at the moment there are not so much signal
specific view plugins, the examples shown here are all for ECG's.)</P

>Chapter 7. Signal Comments</H1
><P
>In RASCHlab comments/annotations to specific time-points or
time-periods in a signal are supported. When a file format support
annotations (e.g. EDF+ or MIT/AHA), RASCHlab can handle (edit and/or
delete) these annotations. Additionally, RASCHlab can add new
comments. The "RASCHlab" comment can be specific for one channel
or can hold for all channels.</P
><P
>To insert a comment, select the position (click on the wanted
position in the signal window) or mark an area (click and move the
mouse while holding the left mouse button down)
and then press the '.' (period) key. Then the comment dialog box
opens (see <A
HREF="#RASCHLAB-ADD-COMMENT-FIG"
>Figure 7-1</A
>)
where the comment can be given. If the comment should be for one
specific channel, the channel can be selected in the drop-down menu at
the top of the dialog box. </P

>When drawing a recording channel, two modes are available: (1)
draw the data centered around a specific niveau and use the given
resolution to scale the amplitude or (2) scale the data in that way,
that the min-value corresponds to the lower channel border and the
max-value corresponds to the upper channel border. When using the
second mode you have the option to set only the min-value and let the
max-value be "controlled" by the resolution.</P
><P
>The niveau used for mode one is a percentage of the channel
height. Typically you use 50%, this means the data is centered around
the middle of the channel.</P
><P
>The first mode is used for data which is centered around a specific
niveau. This is typical for ECG's. The second mode is used for data
which are normally in a specific range. This mode is used for example
for continues blood pressure recordings.</P
