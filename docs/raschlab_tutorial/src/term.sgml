<para>
This section gives a short descritpion of the terminology
used in this tutorial.
<para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term>Measurement</term>
<listitem>
<para>
A measurement is the topmost object in libRASCH. Measurements
consists of one or more sessions, information about the measurement
object (e.g. name, forename and birthday if the measurement object is
a person) and zero or more evaluations.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>


<varlistentry><term>Session</term>
<listitem>
<para>
A Session is a recording for a specific time interval without any
interruptions during this time interval. In a measurement can be more
than one session, but the layout of the recording (see below)
must not be changed.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>


<varlistentry><term>Recording</term>
<listitem>
<para>
A recording contains the measured data (e.g. ECG leads V1-V6). A
recording has one or more channels or two or more
sub-recordings. Sub-recordings are used if more than one
recording device is used. For example when one Analog/Digital
converter-system records
3 ECG leads and one bloodpressure channel and another system
records 12 EEG leads, the measurement consists of one top
recording with two sub-recordings. The first sub-recording
contains 4 channels (3 ECG and 1 bloodpressure channel) and the second
sub-recording contains 12 channels (12 EEG channels). 
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>


<varlistentry id="evaluation"><term>Evaluation</term>
<listitem>
<para>
The results of an analysis (e.g. positions of heart beats in an ECG)
are stored in an evaluation. An evaluation contains zero or more
discrete events (e.g. 'occurence of a heart beat') and/or zero or
more continous events (e.g. 'recording period with noise'). In
measurements handled by libRASCH, more than one evaluation can be
available.
</para>
<para>
When an evaluation is added to the measurement by the original
recording system (e.g. the evaluation performed by commercial
long-term ECG systems), then this evaluation is called the
<emphasis>original</emphasis> evaluation.
</para>
<para>
If only one evaluation is available, it is no problem to choose an
evaluation when the user wants to process the evaluation. When more
than one evaluation is stored in a measurement, one of these
evaluations has to be the <emphasis>default</emphasis>
evaluation, which is used when no specific evaluation is selected. In
most cases the last added evaluation is set to the default
evaluation.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Event</term>
<listitem>
<para>
An event describes the occurence of something in a recording (e.g. a
heartbeat in an ECG). An event has one or more event-properties.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Event-Property</term>
<listitem>
<para>
An event-property is a specific property of the event (e.g. the position
of the event, the type of the event). A specific event-property is
allowed only once in an evaluation, for example there can be not more than one
'qrs-position' property.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Event-Set</term>
<listitem>
<para>
An event-set describes a group of event-properties. For example the
event-set 'heartbeat' contains all properties which belongs to a heart
beat (e.g. position of the heart beat, the RR interval, the type of the
heart beat, systolic blood pressure).
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Plugins</term>
<listitem>
<para>
libRASCH makes heavy use of plugins. Plugins are small "programs" which
are loaded when libRASCH is initialized. In the plugins the real work is
done, the library-code "only" coordinates that the correct plugin is used and
does some other administrative tasks.

In libRASCH three principal types of plugins exist: 
<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
<listitem><para>access plugins</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>view plugins</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>process plugins</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<varlistentry><term>Access-Plugin</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Access plugins handle the access to measurement files. They hide
the differences of the various types of formats and offer
an consistent interface to the measurements<footnote>
<para>
The signal plugins can be compared with device drivers in operating
systems.
</para></footnote>.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>Process-Plugin</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Process plugins perform a specifc task on the measurement (e.g. the
HRV-plugin calculates the Heart-Rate Variability parameters for an
ECG or the detect plugin performs a simple beat detection in ECG's).
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term>View-Plugin</term>
<listitem>
<para>
View plugins allow to display the measurements on the screen. At the
moment the following GUI's are supported:
<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
<listitem><para>Qt from Trolltech (for Linux)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>MFC from Microsoft (for Windows)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

</variablelist>
