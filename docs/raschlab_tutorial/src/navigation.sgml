<section><title>Navigation in the signal window</title>
<para>
If there is more than one window in the signal window, then you
have to select the signal window which should be used. To do this,
click in the sub-window. Then a black frame in
the sub-window will be shown and this sub-window has the input
focus. <xref linkend="raschlab-more-sigs-fig"> shows an example of
a measurement containing three ECG channels, one arterial blood
pressure channel and one respiration channel. In the example the
ecg-sub-window has the input focus (shown by the black frame around
the ecg-sub-window).

<para>
To browse through the signal, you can use the horizontal slider on the
bottom of the signal window or you can use the following keys:
<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
<listitem><para>'cursor left' (<-): 1/10th back in the signal</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>'cursor right' (->): 1/10th forward in the signal</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>'shift + cursor left' or 'page up': one page back in the signal</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>'shift + cursor right' or 'page down': one page forward in the signal</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

</section>


<section><title>Selections</title>

<para>
In the signal-view-plugins, libRASCH supports the concept of
selections. Selections are a subset of events which have one common
property. For example you can select all heart beats which belongs
to the same template (i.e. all heart beats with similar morphology)
or you can select all ventricular beats. 
</para>

<para>
In these selctions, you can step back and forth with the following keys:
<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
<listitem><para>'space bar': go to the next item in the selection</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>'b': go to the previous item in the selection</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
When a selection is "active", then the number of selected events and
the current position in the selection is shown in the signal view in
the lower right corner. The figure "12/456" means that you are
currently at the 12th event from 456 selected events. For example the
numbers inside the red circle in <xref linkend="raschlab-sel-template-fig">.
</para>

<para>
Selections are implemented in the signal-specific view
plugins. Therefore the type of selections will differ from signal to
signal but the concept will be always the same independent of the
signal type. (Because at the moment there are not so much signal
specific view plugins, the examples shown here are all for ECG's.)
</para>

<para>
<xref linkend="raschlab-context-menu-fig"> shows the context menu which
pops up when pressing the right mouse button inside an ecg view. The
main context menu has three entries: (1) General Options, (2) Channel
Options and (3) ecg. The first two entries are available in all
view-plugins and will be described in <xref linkend="settings">. The
third entry (ecg) is only available in ecg views. The ecg entry has
two sub entries: (1) sort and (2) templates. <xref
linkend="raschlab-context-menu-fig"> shows the sub menu of the sort entry
and <xref linkend="raschlab-context-menu-2-fig"> shows the sub menu of the
template entry.
</para>

<para>
When you are interested in specific beat types (e.g. all ventricular
beats or all artifacts) then you have to choose the wanted beat type
from the sort menu. If you are interested in a specific template, then
you have to choose the template from the template menu. After the
selection of the selection criteria, the first beat in the selection
is shown in the signal window. The selection is sorted chronological.
</para>

<section><title>Inter Plugin Communication</title>

<para>
All plugins in libRASCH can communicate with each other. This
communication allows the selection of a signal position or the
selection of specific events through view-plugins which are not in the
signal window. For example, you can select a postion in the tachogram
by clicking on it and the signal in the signal window will positioned
to this position. <xref linkend="raschlab-sel-tacho-pos-fig"> shows an
example. In the tachogram the short RR Interval (which is followed by
a longer RR interval) was selected (marked with a vertical bar). In
the ecg-view, the beat with the short RR interval is shown in the
middle of the window and is marked also with a vertical bar (the
cursor).
</para>

<para>
If you are interested in a specific template, you can select the beats
belonging to this template as described above. Another way is to
double click on the wanted template in the template window (<xref
linkend="raschlab-sel-template-fig">). This has the same effect as
selecting the template from the pop-up menu.
