<chapter id="open-signal"><title>Open a Signal</title>

<para>
After starting RASCHlab, an empty workspace is shown. In this
workspace the signal and other information about the signal will be
shown. Now the first step will be to open a signal. To do this, select
the menu entry 'File/Open...' or press the open button on the toolbar
(an opening folder; the first button from left). This will open the
signal selection dialog box. <xref linkend="raschlab-sig-sel-fig"> shows
the screen shot with the dialog box. The signal selection dialog box
is similar to the file browser in Windows, on the left side you can
select the folder. On the right side, the signals in the
selected folder will be shown. (Only the signals which are supported
by libRASCH are shown.)

<para>
Now select the folder 'LIBRASCH_ROOT/examples/database' on Linux
systems and 'LIBRASCH_INSTALL_ROOT\examples\database' on Windows
systems on the left side<footnote><para>LIBRASCH_ROOT is the
directory of the libRASCH distribution on your system and LIBRASCH_INSTALL_ROOT
is the directory selected while installing
libRASCH</para></footnote>. After selecting the
folder, the available signals will be shown. Please select the signal
named '100s'. This is a short ECG (one minute) from the
PhysioNet database. To open the signal, you can double click on the 
signal-name or select the signal by clicking once on the signal-name
and then click on the OK button. Then the signal will be shown in the
signal window. <xref linkend="raschlab-plain-ecg-fig">
shows RASCHlab with the signal window showing the ECG. The signal
window is a libRASCH view-plugin.

<para>
In the signal window, all channels of a measurement are shown. When
the measurement contains more than one type of signal (e.g. ECG and
arterial blood pressure) then each type of signal will be shown in
their own signal window (for an example see <xref
linkend="raschlab-more-sigs-fig">). To do this, libRASCH has to
"detect" which signals are stored in a measurement. In general purpose
file formats (e.g. file formats used by ADC systems), libRASCH tries
to estimate the signal-type by the channel name. In file formats which
have a fixed channel/signal-type relation, the signal type is set by
the plugin supporting the file format.
