RASCHlab is a program based on libRASCH (http://www.librasch.org), which allows the user to
access time-series data. Additionally the user can process the signals
(e.g. perform a beat detection in ECG's) and perform calculations
based on the signals (e.g. calculate heart rate variability parameters
from an ECG).
</para>

<para>
The program provides access to different file formats (e.g. EDF(+),
MIT/AHA) and displays the informations which are included in a
signal. For example comments/annotations in an EDF+ file is shown and
the user can edit a comment or add a new one. Or when ECG's contain
informations about the position and types of the heart beats, RASCHlab
will show the positions and the user can edit/delete/insert the
beat positions.

<para>
This tutorial will show you the fundamental usage of RASCHlab. All
examples are shown on ECG's but generally it can be used for every
kind of signal.
</para>

<para>
At the moment libRASCH (the basis of RASCHlab)
supports best signals used in cardiology (e.g. ECG, continuous blood
pressure) by special plugins for displaying and processing these
signals. If you have experience with signal processing in other fields
and some ideas what would be nice to have in libRASCH/RASCHlab, please
send me an email (rasch@med1.med.tum.de) with your ideas and/or source
code.
