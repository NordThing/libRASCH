RASCHlab provides the possibility to get informations about the loaded
libRASCH plugins. To get the plugin info dialog box, select the menu
entry 'General->Plugin infos...' and a dialog like the one shown in
<xref linkend="raschlab-plugin-dlg-fig"> opens. In the upper half of
the dialog, the loaded plugins are shown. The name, type and license
of each plugin is listed. In the bottom half of the dialog,
informations about the current select plugin is shown: the name and
the version of the plugin, a short description,
the location of the plugin on the system, if the plugin should be used
and the time stamp when the plugin was build.

<para>
When you are interested about the evaluations in a measurement, you
can get informations about them by selecting the menu entry
'General->Evaluation infos...'. An evaluation dialog box like the one
shown in <xref linkend="raschlab-eval-dlg-fig"> is opened. In the
upper half, a list of the evaluations in the current openend
measurement is shown. You can delete the current selected evaluation
by pressing the 'delete' button right to the list. In the bottom half,
informations about the current selected evaluation is shown: a short
description, if this is the default evaluation (see <xref
linkend="evaluation"> in <xref linkend="term">), if this is the original evalution (again, see
<xref linkend="evaluation"> in <xref linkend="term">), when 
the evaluation was created, in which program, by which
user and on which computer it was created and finally when was the last
modification. The event properties of the current evaluation are
shown in the event-property dialog box, which opens when the
'event-prop's' button is pressed.

<para>
The event-properties dialog box (<xref
linkend="raschlab-evprop-dlg-fig">) lists the event properties of an
evaluation. In the upper half the available event properties are
listed. If you (really) want to delete an event property, you can do
it by pressing the 'delete' button. In the bottom half of the dialog
box, informations about the current selected event property is shown:
the name and how many events are stored in the property, a short
description, the type of the value (e.g. long integer, double, string)
and what type of event property it is (discrete like heart beats or
continuous like periods of noise).
