<para>
In RASCHlab comments/annotations to specific time-points or
time-periods in a signal are supported. When a file format support
annotations (e.g. EDF+ or MIT/AHA), RASCHlab can handle (edit and/or
delete) these annotations. Additionally, RASCHlab can add new
comments. The "RASCHlab" comment can be specific for one channel
or can hold for all channels.
</para>

<para>
To insert a comment, select the position (click on the wanted
position in the signal window) or mark an area (click and move the
mouse while holding the left mouse button down)
and then press the '.' (period) key. Then the comment dialog box
opens (see <xref linkend="raschlab-add-comment-fig">)
where the comment can be given. If the comment should be for one
specific channel, the channel can be selected in the drop-down menu at
the top of the dialog box.

Additionally to the comment text, you can set indicators. At the
moment there are two possible indicators, "Noise" and "ignore
data". These indicators can be used in programs which use libRASCH when
the evaluation of the measurement is analyzed.
