<section id="raschlab-ecg-view-desc"><title>ECG View-Plugin</title>

<para>
The ecg view-plugin displays ECG and ECG related information
(e.g. type of the heart beat, RR interval). The user can edit the
evaluation of the ECG, he can insert or delete a beat or he can change
the type of the beat. Additionally he can "create" ECG specific
selections which can be helpful while inspecting/correcting an automatic
evaluation.
</para>

<para>
If the user wants to edit a beat, the beat has to be selected first by
clicking in the area around the position of the beat (marked by the
beat annoation). The current selected beat is highlighted by a bold
beat annotation and the cursor (vertical line) is on the postion of
the beat. After selecting a beat the following actions can be done:
<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
<listitem><para>'d': delete current selected beat</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>'n': mark current selected beat as normal</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>'v': mark current selected beat as ventricular</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>'x': mark current selected beat as artifact</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
If the user wants to insert a beat, the position has to be
marked by the cursor by clicking at the wanted position. Then use one
of the following keys to insert a beat:
<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
<listitem><para>'n': insert a normal beat</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>'v': insert a ventricular beat</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>'x': insert an artifact</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
The following ECG specific selections are available (press the key
while the ecg view has the input focus):
<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
<listitem><para>'k': select all beats sorted with the shortest RR
interval first</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>'l': select all beats sorted with the longest RR
interval first</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

</section>


<section id="raschlab-abp-view-desc"><title>Blood Pressure View-Plugin</title>

<para>
The blood pressure view-plugin displays continuous blood
pressure signals and blood pressure related informations
(e.g. systolic and diastolic blood pressure).
</para>

<para>
When the position of a blood pressure measurement point has to be corrected,
the user have to click on the new position in the blood pressure view
(the cursor marks the position) and then press one of the
following keys:
<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
<listitem><para>'1': the current position is choosen for the diastolic measurement
point</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>'2': the current position is choosen for the systolic measurement
point</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
The user can change the
position where the systolic and diastolic blood pressure is measured
and can mark the blood pressure values as invalid when the pulse wave
is distorted. To do this, first select the current pulse wave and then
press the 'x' key. If you want to delete the mark, just press 'x'
again.
