 first sample
.IP "num_data" 12
 number of samples

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function returns the sample's (raw-signal data) from the measurement mh and the recording rh. The first sample in data will be the sample number start (in sampleunits) and max. num_data are in data. The memory for buffer data must  be allocated in calling function. The samples returned in this function are the samples as stored in the file. If the size of one sample is greater than 4 bytes, the upper part of the samples are stored in the data_high buffer. If the size is not greater than 4 bytes, the buffer is not needed.
