.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Opens the measurement file and returns a handle to the measurement. If the fast-flag is set, some initialisation-code (e.g. reading evaluation infos from the files) will not be done. This can be useful if only information about the measurment-object is needed but not about the evaluation. Getting the evaluation infos can be "very" time consuming.
