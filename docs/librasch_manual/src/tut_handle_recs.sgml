<para>
The example will show how to get the root recording and some
information about it. We will perform the following steps:
<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
<listitem><para>get root recording</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>get some general informations about the recording</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>get some infos about all used recording devices</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>get some infos about all recorded channels</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
When more than one recording device was used, the root recording
provides access to the channels as if they were recorded with one
device.

When asking for information about recording devices you need to set
the device number. In Perl and Python this is done by setting the argument 'dev'
to the device number. In C the device number is set in the
value_handle (using ra_value_set_number()) used to receive the
information when calling ra_info_get().
