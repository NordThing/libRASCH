<para>
When analyzing biological signals, access to the raw data is
mandatory. Because of different demands, both, the industry and the
research community created a high number of different data formats for
signal storage and signal distribution. To analyze data stored in a
new data format, either a conversion program has to be written or the
access functionality for the new data format has to be added to the
analyzing program(s).
</para>

<para>
One way to solve this problem is the use of a standard file format,
which is powerful enough to handle all needs for storing and
distributing signals. For physiological signals, the 'File Exchange
Format for Vital Signs' (FEF) tries to accomplish this task. If
this format (or a similar one) is accepted by the research community
and if the industry provides the possibility to export the signal data
in this format, the data access will be facilitated.
</para>

<para>
Our approach, moreover, is different. We assume that there will be
always different data formats (some 'standard' formats and a lot of
proprietary formats). Therefore libRASCH, a programming
library, was developed, which hides the differences of the data formats
behind a common application programming interface (API).
</para>

<para>
Programs using libRASCH, no longer need to be adapted to each new
data format. The implementation of a new data format needs only to be
done once for libRASCH. Than all libRASCH based programs can handle
the new format. 
</para>

<para>
Additionally, libRASCH provides the infrastructure to perform
processing algorithms in a standardized way and provide support to
display the signal data on the computer screen.
