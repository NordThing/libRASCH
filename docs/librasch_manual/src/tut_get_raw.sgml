<para>
The example will show how to get the root recording and some
information about it. We will perform the following steps:
<itemizedlist mark=bullet>
<listitem><para>get root recording</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>get some general informations about the recording</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>get some infos about all used recording devices</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>get some infos about all recorded channels</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
When more than one recording device was used, the root recording
provides access to the channels as if they were recorded with one
device.
