libRASCH provides a common interface for access to physiologic signals in a wide variety of formats, including several that are not supported by the WFDB software package. Currently, the following formats are supported: CFS, DasyLab, EDF+, ISHNE-Holter, MIT/AHA (WFDB) and Poly5/TMS32. The library is written in C and is available for Linux and Windows. The software also provides support for processing (e.g. beat detection in an ECG) and viewing the signals. This functionality and the access to the various file formats is realized with plugins.

For further information, please write to Raphael Schneider.

General
-------

libRASCH is a library for accessing signals/recordings saved
in several file-formats. libRASCH provides a common interface to
the signals, regardless of the used format. Additionally it
provides support to process (e.g. detect beats in an ecg or calculate
heart rate variability parameters) and view the signals. At the
moment the main focus of libRASCH is to handle biological signals
(e.g. ECG, EEG, blood-pressure) but the design of the library 
allows to handle any kind of signal.

The library is available for
- Linux and
- Windows

libRASCH is written in C and provides interfaces for
- Perl
- Python
- Octave for Linux
- Matlab
- Scilab (at the moment only for Linux)
